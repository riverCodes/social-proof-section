## My process
-I first created the layout in a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/rivercodes/pen/LYQPmjK) using colored div's. This gave me the opportunity to test out both Grid and Flexbox and create a wireframe model of the component.
-I then started with the mobile design, as it was simpler and styled the individual components. I used Grid Areas for the main sections of the main component. I used nested flexbox for the styling of the individual components.
-I then proceeded with the desktop design. It was not too hard, and I feel like my understanding of flexbox and grid has increased
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a lot about grid and flexbox in this challenge. I can now visualize how I want to use both to create complex layouts. I am proud of the grid areas that I used that allowed me to switch between mobile and desktop views fairly easily.
